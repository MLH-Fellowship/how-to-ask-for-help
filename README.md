## Be precise

It's hard to provide support if all we know about your problem is "My printer doesn't work." or "My mail server doesn't work.". How are others supposed to help you when you don't give them any information? Make sure you include at least this information:

- What did you try to accomplish? (I'm trying to run `npm install`)
- What has happened (wrongly) instead? (I get `ENOENT`)
- What environment are you using? (I am on Mac Catalina with Node v12)
- What did you try to find the cause? (I already tried deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling.)
- Are there error message or log files? (The error message is `ENOENT`)
- Has it ever worked? What did you change? (I just pulled the latest changes. It worked before that.)

If all this information is included then you will have a high chance of getting a useful reply.

## Tell what you are doing

Others only know what you tell them. If you change things silently then nobody will know about it. Don't say "I changed something. Now I have another problem," use the guide above to communicate your new problem.

## Don't ask to ask

It's a bad manner if someone enters a support channel and asks "May I ask a question?" or "Can anyone help me?". Although that may be polite in normal human interaction, if you're already in a support channel we know you need help! You can ask your question right away.

## Unintended rudeness

Sometimes you may feel that others are rude. You may get a response like "Reinstall the package. Restart the service. Read the /usr/share/doc/mysoftware/README." Although this is a very brief reply it is likely not meant to be rude. IRC is often like human interaction without all the friendly bits. Other people have probably answered your question a dozen of times today and they just want to help you solve the problem - not become close friends with you. Don't be offended by it. The people don't mean it.

## Do not repeat yourself

Asking the same question every minute is annoying. If anyone in the channel isn't paying attention then they will neither read you the second and third time. And those who came back from lunch or sleep will likely see in their "lastlog" what has happened lately. This is too demanding..

## Read the documentation

If people tell you to read the documentation then you should do so. Never say: "I'm too lazy. Come on. You all know what I need to do. Just tell me what I need to do." This will get you ignored for all eternity. However you can expect to be told where to find the documentation. But if you get an URL then get it and read it. If the documentation is too technical or you don't understand certain sections then say: "I have now read chapter 3.1 of the URL you gave me and I understand how virtual domains work in general. But how would I use both virtual and non-virtual domains together?"

## Stay if you can

Using IRC is a matter of give and take. At the beginning you will surely you'll have questions over questions. Just ask them and be grateful if you get attention and replies. Others do not expect more than a "Thank you." for their help.

If you can, please consider staying online in the channel. The more knowledge you gain the more you can help other people. And you probably get to know people you like to hang out with - even if it's just virtually.

## Tell others about the solution

It doesn't help anyone if you just say "Nevermind, found it." and quit the channel. Please tell the others what the solution to your problem was so everybody can learn from it. You will not look stupid - trust me.

## Do not flood the channel - use a pastebin

Sometimes you need to show others more than one line. Perhaps parts of your configuration files or a log file. Never just copy and paste larger amounts of text right into the channel. Always use a pastebin. Pastebins are public services (web sites) where you can paste your text and everybody can access them as a URL. Just paste your contents there and send the URL into the channel. That should allow everybody who's interested to take a look. Just don't paste it without any comment. Rather say: "Emails seem to get lost since I installed program foobar. Please take a look at my logs: http://..." See the [list of pastebin services](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) on the internet.
